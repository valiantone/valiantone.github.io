Frequent Bayesianism is a cheeky, made up term that invokes an outdated, ideological debate in the field of probability and data science. With little meaning it serves as great name for a personal publication.

This blog features a variety of digital fundamentals ranging from career to code, data to design.

This blog was primarily set up to support self-starters who would like to stay on top of latest developments in core CS topics (databases, algorithms, networks and operating systems) and data science. Additionally, I also curate posts pertaining to my experience in the realm of digital learning, volunteering and community projects.

## Our Audience

For the last 3 years or so, I have been volunteering with [TechLabs Berlin](https://techlabs.org/location/berlin) in capacity as an instructor and teaching assistant; supporting students on their journey to acquire skills in Data Science & Deep Learning.

This can at times be quite an uphill challenge as we struggle to stay on top of the latest developments in this field. Due to the limited resources of a non-profit, we cannot always keep our curriculum up-to-date. Hence, a supporting resource is required to bridge the gap between coursework that established strong fundamentals and the latest advancements in technology. Frequent Bayesianism strives to be that bridge!
